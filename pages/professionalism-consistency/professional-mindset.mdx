# The Professional Mindset

To truly implement the principles from *The War of Art* and overcome Resistance, it's essential to cultivate a professional mindset. This means approaching your creative work with the same level of commitment, discipline, and seriousness that you would bring to any other profession.

## Characteristics of a Professional

According to Steven Pressfield, a professional:

- Shows up every day, no matter what
- Stays on the job all day
- Commits over the long haul
- Receives praise or blame in the real world
- Dedicates themselves to mastering technique
- Has a sense of humor about their work
- Accepts remuneration for their labor
- Doesn't overidentify with the job

Professionalism is not about perfection; it's about consistency and dedication. It's about showing up and doing the work, even when you don't feel like it.

## Adopting the Professional Mindset

To adopt a professional mindset, follow these steps:

<Steps>

### Step 1: Commit to your craft

Make a conscious decision to treat your creative work as a profession, not just a hobby or a passing interest. This means:

- Setting regular work hours
- Establishing a dedicated workspace
- Investing in the necessary tools and resources

### Step 2: Develop a routine

Professionals thrive on routine. Establish a daily practice that supports your creative work, such as:

- Morning pages or journaling
- Regular exercise or meditation
- Scheduled breaks and rest periods

### Step 3: Embrace the principle of "territorialism"

Focus on your own creative territory, rather than comparing yourself to others or seeking external validation. As Pressfield explains in [The Territorial Perspective](/higher-inspiration/territorial-perspective), this means:

- Defining your own metrics for success
- Staying true to your unique voice and vision
- Letting go of the need for approval or recognition

### Step 4: Cultivate a growth mindset

Embrace challenges and setbacks as opportunities for learning and growth. As a professional, you understand that:

- Failure is a natural part of the creative process
- Criticism and feedback can be valuable tools for improvement
- Mastery requires continuous practice and refinement

</Steps>

## The Professional Mindset in Action

Here's an example of how the professional mindset might look in practice:

A[Set regular work hours] --> B[Show up consistently]
B --> C[Focus on the work, not the outcome]
C --> D[Embrace challenges and setbacks]
D --> E[Continuously refine your craft]
```

By adopting a professional mindset, you can overcome Resistance and unlock your full creative potential. Remember, as Pressfield writes:

> "The professional has learned that success, like happiness, comes as a by-product of work."

So, commit to your craft, show up consistently, and trust in the power of the creative process. With a professional mindset, you can achieve great things.
