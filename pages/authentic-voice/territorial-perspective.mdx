# The Territorial Perspective

In his book, *The War of Art*, Steven Pressfield introduces the concept of the **territorial perspective** as a way to stay focused on your own creative work without getting caught up in hierarchical thinking or external validation. By adopting this mindset, you can maintain your authenticity and produce your best work.

## Understanding the Territorial vs. Hierarchical Orientation

Pressfield distinguishes between two ways of approaching your creative endeavors:

1. **Hierarchical Orientation**: Focusing on your position relative to others, seeking validation, and competing for status.
2. **Territorial Orientation**: Concentrating on your own creative territory, regardless of others' opinions or achievements.

The hierarchical orientation can be detrimental to your creativity, as it shifts your attention away from the work itself and towards external factors.

## Claiming Your Creative Territory

To embrace the territorial perspective, you must identify and claim your own creative territory. This is the space where you feel most authentic, energized, and inspired. It could be a physical location, a particular medium, or a specific theme or subject matter.

<Steps>

### Step 1: Reflect on your passions and strengths
Consider what you're naturally drawn to and where you excel. These areas are likely to be part of your creative territory.

### Step 2: Experiment and explore
Try out different creative pursuits, styles, and subjects to discover what resonates with you.

### Step 3: Commit to your territory
Once you've identified your creative territory, fully embrace it. Dive deep into your chosen area and make it your own.

## Focusing on the Work Itself

When you operate from a territorial perspective, your primary concern is the work itself. You're not worried about how it compares to others' creations or whether it will garner praise. Instead, you're fully engaged in the process of bringing your vision to life.

This focus allows you to:

- Develop your unique voice and style
- Take creative risks and experiment freely
- Produce work that is authentic and meaningful to you

As Pressfield writes, "The artist must operate territorially. He must do his work for its own sake."

## Letting Go of External Validation

One of the key aspects of maintaining a territorial perspective is letting go of the need for external validation. This means creating for the sake of the work itself, rather than seeking approval or recognition from others.

While it's natural to want your work to be appreciated, basing your creative worth on others' opinions can be detrimental. It can lead to:

- Self-doubt and creative blocks
- Compromising your vision to please others
- Feeling discouraged by criticism or lack of recognition

Instead, focus on staying true to your own creative instincts and trusting the value of your work, regardless of external feedback.

## Embracing the Journey

Adopting a territorial perspective also means embracing the creative journey, with all its ups and downs. Rather than fixating on the end result or success, you learn to find joy and fulfillment in the process itself.

This mindset helps you:

- Stay motivated and committed to your work
- Learn and grow from challenges and setbacks
- Maintain a sense of curiosity and experimentation

By focusing on your own creative territory and embracing the journey, you can tap into a deep well of inspiration and produce work that is truly authentic and meaningful.
